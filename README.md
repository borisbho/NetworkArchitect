# NetworkArchitect

C# program that can take in data describing Ethernet ports throughout an office and the distance between each. Your application will then produce two sets of output: the minimum amount of cable needed to serial connect the ports and the suggested location of the network hub to achieve the best normalized latency to all connected devices.
